A pet project of mine, in the same vein as videogame randomizers, but with Magic The Gathering!

Uses a BoiseCodeworks template for basic MVC pattern functionality.


## Goals

get up to date data on MTG cards - complete

create a draft/sealed pool with varied and controlled ratios of card types

a simple client to draft or build and play with your friends.
